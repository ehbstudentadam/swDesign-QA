## Decorator: Starbuzz Coffee
Starbuzz Coffee has made a name for itself as the fastest growing coffee shop around.

In addition to your coffee (HouseBlend €1, DarkRoast €1.5, Decaf €1.2, Espresso €2),
you can also ask for several condiments like steamed milk (€0.20), soy (€0.30), and
mocha (€0.50) (otherwise known as chocolate), and have it all topped off with whipped
milk (€0.25). Starbuzz charges a bit for each of these, so they really need to get them
built into their order system.

Build them a system which is flexible and future proof.

Test the system: the first customer orders a DarkRoast with Mocha and Whipped Cream.
