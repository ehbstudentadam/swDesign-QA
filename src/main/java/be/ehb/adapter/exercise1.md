## Adapter pattern
Implement a WildTurkey class which confirms to the Turkey interface. The Turkey
interface has two methods: gobble() & fly().

Next step is implementing a Duck interface with the methods quack() & fly(). Implement
a MallardDuck which confirms to this interface.

In your main method, put both classes in a list of Ducks using the adapter pattern and
let them quack & fly.
