## LOTR

We have to implement a game. This game has several characters: a King, an Elf, a
Dwarf and a Hobbit. Each character can fight and we have several weapons they can
fight with: a knife, a bow and arrow, an axe and a sword. Each character will start out
with a default weapon but can change its weapon during the game.

In the next version of the game several new characters and weapons will be added.

Implement the base classes for the game and make them future-proof.
