## Photo library
After a few years of traveling with a beautiful reflex camera, you decide to write a
program which will help you organize your photos according to where you took these
photos.

Implement an application in which you can store the places you took the pictures. For
certain parts of the world you have taken that many pictures that you want to provide a
further subdivision under this location. In this subdivision you would like to subdivide
even further according to street or district before placing the effective pictures in it.

Implement a solution for this problem. As an example enter the following information
and print the result to the console.

- België
  - Brussel
    - Anderlecht
